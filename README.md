NOTES
==========

hsqldb dump created with command `SCRIPT 'd:\projects\vaadin\vaadin-test-app\db_sql.sql';`

I used following settings in IDEA when creating hsqldb: http://imgur.com/a/0uT7I

In theory database dump should be impotable after database creation through database console

Note: Remember to disconnect you database tools from hsqldb before opening pages

Directory db includes current hsql DDL and some test data
